1) Categorize the problem
By input
 - labeled data is a supervised learning problem
 - unlabeled data is an unsupervised learning problem
 - a solution that implies to optimize an objective function by interacting with an environment it's a reinforcement learning problem
By output
 - Regression Problem: output of the model is a number
 - Classification Problem: output of the model is a class
 - Clustering Problem: output of a model is a set of input groups

 2) Understand the data
    Analyze - use descriptive statistics and plots to visualize
    Process - pre-processing, profiliing, cleansing
    Transform - transform data from raw state to one suitable for modeling

 4) Find available algorithms

 5) Implement ML algorithms

 Supervised
 - Human teaches the algorithm what conclusions it should come up with. Outputs are known ahead & training data is labeled with correct answers. 

 Unsupervised
 -  There is less information about objects, in particular, the train set is unlabeled. Itâ€™s possible to observe some similarities between groups of objects and include them in appropriate 
     clusters. Some objects can differ hugely from all clusters, in this way these objects to be anomalies.

Reinforcement
- Goal oriented algorithms that lean how to attain a complex objective or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps.
