# Machine Learning
In this repository you can find a collection of practice problems I've completed to improve my ability to effectively apply some common machine learning algorithms, as well as provide a resource for others wanting to develop their knowledge about machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### Libraries
* scikit-learn (sklearn/scipy) - The sklearn library contains efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling. I chose to use this library for certain topics due to its accessibility and simplicity. I have found that this library is excellent for simpler data analysis tasks, but not the best choice for deep learning related problems.
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

### Algorithms
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* More to come
